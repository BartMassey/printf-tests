# Various `printf` Tests
Bart Massey

This directory contains printf test files culled from free
and open source software packages. Every attempt has been
made to preserve the authorship and licensing of these
source files: see the source files themselves for this
information.  No attempt has been made to alter these in any
way: the printf-test suite constructed in this distribution
uses these as abstract source material.

* `tests-gcc-c90-printf-`*`.c`: Tests from GCC.
* `tests-ghc-printf.hs`: Three regression tests from GHC.
* `tests-libc-sprintf.c`: Tests from GNU libc.
* `tests-msvcrt-printf.c`: Tests from the Wine MSVCRT
  implementation.
* `tests-npm-printf.coffee`: Tests from the NPM `node.js`
  package manager.
