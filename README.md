# `printf` Tests
Copyright Â© 2013 Bart Massey

This project is an attempt to pull together various
`printf`(3) tests from free and open source software
projects and compile them into a single language-independent
file that is at least nearly equal to the sum of its parts.

draws upon sources that are either GPL v2 or under licenses
compatible with GPL v2. Please see the `sources` directory

repeating here.
